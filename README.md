## Introduction
Whether we wish to predict the trend in financial markets or electricity consumption, time is an important factor that must now be considered in our models. For example, it would be interesting to forecast at what hour during the day is there going to be a peak consumption in electricity, such as to adjust the price or the production of electricity.
Enter the time series.
A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.

## Overview
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Decomposition of data
3. Test the stationarity
4. Fit a model used an automated algorithm
5. Calculate forecasts
